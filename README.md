# Agro robots simulators 

We present a distributed multi-agent architecture for an autonomous fleet route coordination of AMRs (autonomous vehicles) called “AGROBOTS”. AGROBOTS system will be composed of AMR route coordination units (RGU) designed as collaborative agents. These agents will collaboratively and dynamically (re)assign tasks and optimize their routes in a distributed way through real-time inter-RGU local information exchange and cooperation. Such a multi-agent system (MAS) is scalable, has fewer levels of authority, and does not suffer from the “single point of failure” problem seen in centralized systems

We base our work on this package: [Patrolling_Sim](https://github.com/davidbsp/patrolling_sim.git).
